## Day 04
# Day 4 Task: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers.

## What is Kernel

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

## What is Shell

A shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readable commands from user and convert them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that execute commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.

## What is Linux Shell Scripting?

A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a linux shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

**Tasks**

- Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
- What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
- Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`
- Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.
- Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

Was it difficult?

- Post about it on LinkedIn and Let me know :)

## Day 05
# Day 5 Task: Advanced Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers with User management

If you noticed that there are a total 90 sub-directories in the directory '2023' of this repository. What did you think, how did I create 90 directories? Manually one by one or using a script, or a command?

All 90 directories within seconds using a simple command.

` mkdir day{1..90}`

### Tasks

1. You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -

So Write a bash script create directories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is the directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates a specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.

Example 1: When the script is executed as

`./createDirectories.sh day 1 90`

then it creates 90 directories as `day1 day2 day3 .... day90`

Example 2: When the script is executed as

`./createDirectories.sh Movie 20 50`
then it creates 50 directories as `Movie20 Movie21 Movie23 ...Movie50`

Notes:
You may need to use loops or commands (or both), based on your preference . [Check out this reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-for-loop/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-for-loop/)

2.  Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.

Backups are an important part of DevOps Engineer's day to Day activities
The video in References will help you to understand How a DevOps Engineer takes backups (it can feel a bit difficult but keep trying, Nothing is impossible.)
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/aolKiws4Joc)

In case of Doubts, post it in [Discord Channel for #90DaysOfDevOps](https://discord.gg/hs3Pmc5F)

3.  Read About Cron and Crontab, to automate the backup Script

Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended. A command called crontab allows the user to submit, edit or delete entries to cron. A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information.

Watch This video as a Reference to Task 2 and 3 [https://youtu.be/aolKiws4Joc](https://youtu.be/aolKiws4Joc)

4.  Read about User Management and Let me know on Linkedin if you're ready for Day 6.

A user is an entity, in a Linux operating system, that can manipulate files and perform several other operations. Each user is assigned an ID that is unique for each user in the operating system. In this post, we will learn about users and commands which are used to get information about the users. After installation of the operating system, the ID 0 is assigned to the root user and the IDs 1 to 999 (both inclusive) are assigned to the system users and hence the ids for local user begins from 1000 onwards.

5.  Create 2 users and just display their Usernames

[Check out this reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-management-in-linux/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-management-in-linux/)

Post your daily work on Linkedin and let [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhamlondhe1996/) know , writing an article is the best :)

## Day 06
# Day 6 Task: File Permissions and Access Control Lists

### Today is more on Reading, Learning and Implementing File permissions

The concept of Linux File permission and ownership is important in Linux.
Here, we will be working on Linux permissions and ownership and will do tasks on
both of them.
Let us start with the Permissions.

1. Create a simple file and do `ls -ltr` to see the details of the files [refer to Notes](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/tree/master/2023/day06/notes)

Each of the three permissions are assigned to three defined categories of users. The categories are:

- owner — The owner of the file or application.
- "chown" is used to change the ownership permission of a file or directory.
- group — The group that owns the file or application.
- "chgrp" is used to change the group permission of a file or directory.
- others — All users with access to the system. (outised the users are in a group)
- "chmod" is used to change the other users permissions of a file or directory.

  As a task, change the user permissions of the file and note the changes after `ls -ltr`

2. Write an article about File Permissions based on your understanding from the notes.

3. Read about ACL and try out the commands `getfacl` and `setfacl`

In case of any doubts, post it on [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/hs3Pmc5F)

Happy Learning

## Day 07
# Day 7 Task: Understanding package manager and systemctl

### What is a package manager in Linux?

In simpler words, a package manager is a tool that allows users to install, remove, upgrade, configure and manage software packages on an operating system. The package manager can be a graphical application like a software center or a command line tool like apt-get or pacman.

You’ll often find me using the term ‘package’ in tutorials and articles, To understand package manager, you must understand what a package is.

### What is a package?

A package is usually referred to an application but it could be a GUI application, command line tool or a software library (required by other software programs). A package is essentially an archive file containing the binary executable, configuration file and sometimes information about the dependencies.

### Different kinds of package managers

Package Managers differ based on packaging system but same packaging system may have more than one package manager.

For example, RPM has Yum and DNF package managers. For DEB, you have apt-get, aptitude command line based package managers.

## Tasks

1.  You have to install docker and jenkins in your system from your terminal using package managers

2.  Write a small blog or article to install these tools using package managers on Ubuntu and CentOS

### systemctl and systemd

systemctl is used to examine and control the state of “systemd” system and service manager. systemd is system and service manager for Unix like operating systems(most of the distributions, not all).

## Tasks

1.  check the status of docker service in your system (make sure you completed above tasks, else docker won't be installed)

2.  stop the service jenkins and post before and after screenshots

3.  read about the commands systemctl vs service

eg. `systemctl status docker` vs `service docker status`

For Reference, read [this](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-check-if-the-docker-daemon-or-a-container-is-running/#:~:text=Checking%20With%20Systemctl&text=Check%20what%27s%20displayed%20under%20%E2%80%9CActive,running%20sudo%20systemctl%20start%20docker%20.)

#### Post about this and bring your friends to this #90DaysOfDevOps challenge.

## Day 08
# Day 8 Task: Basic Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers.

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people. It is commonly used for software development, but it can be used to track changes to any set of files.

With Git, you can keep a record of who made changes to what part of a file, and you can revert back to earlier versions of the file if needed. Git also makes it easy to collaborate with others, as you can share changes and merge the changes made by different people into a single version of a file.

## What is Github?

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and it offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. GitHub is a very popular platform for developers to share and collaborate on projects, and it is also used for hosting open-source projects.

## What is Version Control? How many types of version controls we have?

Version control is a system that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

There are two main types of version control systems: centralized version control systems and distributed version control systems.

1. A centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all the versions of a project's files. Developers "check out" files from the central server, make changes, and then "check in" the updated files. Examples of CVCS include Subversion and Perforce.

2. A distributed version control system (DVCS) allows developers to "clone" an entire repository, including the entire version history of the project. This means that they have a complete local copy of the repository, including all branches and past versions. Developers can work independently and then later merge their changes back into the main repository. Examples of DVCS include Git, Mercurial, and Darcs.

## Why we use distributed version control over centralized version control?

1. Better collaboration: In a DVCS, every developer has a full copy of the repository, including the entire history of all changes. This makes it easier for developers to work together, as they don't have to constantly communicate with a central server to commit their changes or to see the changes made by others.

2. Improved speed: Because developers have a local copy of the repository, they can commit their changes and perform other version control actions faster, as they don't have to communicate with a central server.

3. Greater flexibility: With a DVCS, developers can work offline and commit their changes later when they do have an internet connection. They can also choose to share their changes with only a subset of the team, rather than pushing all of their changes to a central server.

4. Enhanced security: In a DVCS, the repository history is stored on multiple servers and computers, which makes it more resistant to data loss. If the central server in a CVCS goes down or the repository becomes corrupted, it can be difficult to recover the lost data.

Overall, the decentralized nature of a DVCS allows for greater collaboration, flexibility, and security, making it a popular choice for many teams.

## Task:

- Install Git on your computer (if it is not already installed). You can download it from the official website at https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Create a free account on GitHub (if you don't already have one). You can sign up at https://github.com/
- Learn the basics of Git by reading through the [video](https://youtu.be/AT1uxOLsCdk) This will give you an understanding of what Git is, how it works, and how to use it to track changes to files.

## Exercises:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine
2. Make some changes to a file in the repository and commit them to the repository using Git
3. Push the changes back to the repository on GitHub

## Day 09
# Day 9 Task: Deep Dive in Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers.

## Find the answers by your understandings(Shoulden't be copied by internet & used hand-made diagrams) of below quistions and Write blog on it.

1. What is Git and why is it important?
2. What is difference Between Main Branch and Master Branch??
3. Can you explain the difference between Git and GitHub?
4. How do you create a new repository on GitHub?
5. What is difference between local & remote repository? How to connect local to remote?

## Tasks

task-1:

- Set your user name and email address, which will be associated with your commits.

task-2:

- Create a repository named "Devops" on GitHub
- Connect your local repository to the repository on GitHub.
- Create a new file in Devops/Git/Day-02.txt & add some content to it
- Push your local commits to the repository on GitHub

reff :- https://youtu.be/AT1uxOLsCdk

Note: These steps assume that you have already installed Git on your computer and have created a GitHub account. If you need help with these prerequisites, you can refer to the [day-08](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/ee7c53f276edb02a85a97282027028295be17c04/2023/day08/README.md)

[← Previous Day](../day08/README.md) | [Next Day →](../day10/README.md)



## Day 10
# Day 10 Task: Advance Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers.

## Git Branching

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

## Git Revert and Reset

Two commonly used tools that git users will encounter are those of git reset and git revert . The benefit of both of these commands is that you can use them to remove or edit changes you’ve made in the code in previous commits.

## Git Rebase and Merge

### What Is Git Rebase?

Git rebase is a command that lets users integrate changes from one branch to another, and the logs are modified once the action is complete. Git rebase was developed to overcome merging’s shortcomings, specifically regarding logs.

### What Is Git Merge?

Git merge is a command that allows developers to merge Git branches while the logs of commits on branches remain intact.

The merge wording can be confusing because we have two methods of merging branches, and one of those ways is actually called “merge,” even though both procedures do essentially the same thing.

Refer to this article for a better understanding of Git Rebase and Merge [Read here](https://www.simplilearn.com/git-rebase-vs-merge-article)

## Task 1:

Add a text file called version01.txt inside the Devops/Git/ with “This is first feature of our application” written inside.
This should be in a branch coming from `master`,
[hint try `git checkout -b dev`],
swithch to `dev` branch ( Make sure your commit message will reflect as "Added new feature").
[Hint use your knowledge of creating branches and Git commit command]

- version01.txt should reflect at local repo first followed by Remote repo for review.
  [Hint use your knowledge of Git push and git pull commands here]

Add new commit in `dev` branch after adding below mentioned content in Devops/Git/version01.txt:
While writing the file make sure you write these lines

- 1st line>> This is the bug fix in development branch
- Commit this with message “ Added feature2 in development branch”

- 2nd line>> This is gadbad code
- Commit this with message “ Added feature3 in development branch

- 3rd line>> This feature will gadbad everything from now.
- Commit with message “ Added feature4 in development branch

Restore the file to a previous version where the content should be “This is the bug fix in development branch”
[Hint use git revert or reset according to your knowledge]

## Task 2:

- Demonstrate the concept of branches with 2 or more branches with screenshot.
- add some changes to `dev` branch and merge that branch in `master`
- as a practice try git rebase too, see what difference you get.

## Note:

We should learn and follow the [best practices](https://www.flagship.io/git-branching-strategies/) , industry follows for branching.

Simple Reference on branching: [video](https://youtu.be/NzjK9beT_CY)

Advance Reference on branching : [video](https://youtu.be/7xhkEQS3dXw)

## Day 11
# Day 11 Task: Advance Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers: Part-2

## Git Stash:

Git stash is a command that allows you to temporarily save changes you have made in your working directory, without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch to a different branch to work on something else, but you don't want to commit the changes you've made in your current branch yet.

To use Git stash, you first create a new branch and make some changes to it. Then you can use the command git stash to save those changes. This will remove the changes from your working directory and record them in a new stash. You can apply these changes later. git stash list command shows the list of stashed changes.

You can also use git stash drop to delete a stash and git stash clear to delete all the stashes.

## Cherry-pick:

Git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them to another. This can be useful when you want to selectively apply changes that were made in one branch to another.

To use git cherry-pick, you first create two new branches and make some commits to them. Then you use git cherry-pick <commit_hash> command to select the specific commits from one branch and apply them to the other.

## Resolving Conflicts:

Conflicts can occur when you merge or rebase branches that have diverged, and you need to manually resolve the conflicts before git can proceed with the merge/rebase.
git status command shows the files that have conflicts, git diff command shows the difference between the conflicting versions and git add command is used to add the resolved files.

# Task-01

- Create a new branch and make some changes to it.
- Use git stash to save the changes without committing them.
- Switch to a different branch, make some changes and commit them.
- Use git stash pop to bring the changes back and apply them on top of the new commits.

# Task-02

- In version01.txt of development branch add below lines after “This is the bug fix in development branch” that you added in Day10 and reverted to this commit.
- Line2>> After bug fixing, this is the new feature with minor alteration”

  Commit this with message “ Added feature2.1 in development branch”

- Line3>> This is the advancement of previous feature

  Commit this with message “ Added feature2.2 in development branch”

- Line4>> Feature 2 is completed and ready for release

  Commit this with message “ Feature2 completed”

- All these commits messages should be reflected in Production branch too which will come out from Master branch (Hint: try rebase).

# Task-03

- In Production branch Cherry pick Commit “Added feature2.2 in development branch” and added below lines in it:
- Line to be added after Line3>> This is the advancement of previous feature
- Line4>>Added few more changes to make it more optimized.
- Commit: Optimized the feature

## Day 14
## Day 14 Task: Python Data Types and Data Structures for DevOps

### New day, New Topic.... Let's learn along 😉

### Data Types

- Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
- Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
- Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string,lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc

To check what is the data type of the variable used, we can simply write:
`your_variable=100`
`type(your_variable)`

### Data Structures

Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.

- Lists
  Python Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type

- Tuple
  Python Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable in nature i.e. the elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created. Just like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types.

- Dictionary
  Python dictionary is like hash tables in any other language with the time complexity of O(1). It is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds the key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized

## Tasks

1. Give the Difference between List, Tuple and set. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.
2. Create below Dictionary and use Dictionary methods to print your favourite tool just by using the keys of the Dictionary.

```
fav_tools =
{
  1:"Linux",
  2:"Git",
  3:"Docker",
  4:"Kubernetes",
  5:"Terraform",
  6:"Ansible",
  7:"Chef"
}
```

3. Create a List of cloud service providers
   eg.

```
cloud_providers = ["AWS","GCP","Azure"]
```

Write a program to add `Digital Ocean` to the list of cloud_providers and sort the list in alphabetical order.

[Hint: Use keys to built in functions for Lists]

If you want to deep dive further, Watch [Python](https://youtu.be/abPgj_3hzVY)

## Day 15
## Day 15 Task: Python Libraries for DevOps

### Reading JSON and YAML in Python

- As a DevOps Engineer you should be able to parse files, be it txt, json, yaml, etc.
- You should know what all libraries one should use in Pythonfor DevOps.
- Python has numerous libraries like `os`, `sys`, `json`, `yaml` etc that a DevOps Engineer uses in day to day tasks.

## Tasks

1. Create a Dictionary in Python and write it to a json File.

2. Read a json file `services.json` kept in this folder and print the service names of every cloud service provider.

```
output

aws : ec2
azure : VM
gcp : compute engine

```

3. Read YAML file using python, file `services.yaml` and read the contents to convert yaml to json

## Day 16
## Day 16 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers.

### Docker

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

# Tasks

As you have already installed docker in previous days tasks, now is the time to run Docker commands.

- Use the `docker run` command to start a new container and interact with it through the command line. [Hint: docker run hello-world]

- Use the `docker inspect` command to view detailed information about a container or image.

- Use the `docker port` command to list the port mappings for a container.

- Use the `docker stats` command to view resource usage statistics for one or more containers.

- Use the `docker top` command to view the processes running inside a container.

- Use the `docker save` command to save an image to a tar archive.

- Use the `docker load` command to load an image from a tar archive.

These tasks involve simple operations that can be used to manage images and containers.

## Day 17
## Day 17 Task: Docker Project for DevOps Engineers.

### You people are doing just amazing in **#90daysofdevops**. Today's challenge is so special Because You are going to do DevOps project today with Docker. Are You Exited 😍

# Dockerfile

Docker is a tool that makes it easy to run applications in containers. Containers are like small packages that hold everything an application needs to run. To create these containers, developers use something called a Dockerfile.

A Dockerfile is like a set of instructions for making a container. It tells Docker what base image to use, what commands to run, and what files to include. For example, if you were making a container for a website, the Dockerfile might tell Docker to use an official web server image, copy the files for your website into the container, and start the web server when the container starts.

For more about Dockerfile visit [here](https://rushikesh-mashidkar.hashnode.dev/dockerfile-docker-compose-swarm-and-volumes)

task:

- Create a Dockerfile for a simple web application (e.g. a Node.js or Python app)

- Build the image using the Dockerfile and run the container

- Verify that the application is working as expected by accessing it in a web browser

- Push the image to a public or private repository (e.g. Docker Hub )

## Day 18
# Day 18 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers

Till now you have created Docker file and pushed it to the Repository. Let's move forward and dig more on other Docker concepts.
Aj thodi padhai krte hai on Docker Compose 😃

## Docker Compose

- Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.
- With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.
- Learn more about docker-compose [visit here](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/docker/docker-compose/)

## What is YAML?

- YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for yet another markup language or YAML ain’t markup language (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents.
- YAML is a popular programming language because it is human-readable and easy to understand.
- YAML files use a .yml or .yaml extension.
- Read more about it [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml)

## Task-1

Learn how to use the docker-compose.yml file, to set up the environment, configure the services and links between different containers, and also to use environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file.

[Sample docker-compose.yaml file](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day18/docker-compose.yaml)

## Task-2

- Pull a pre-existing Docker image from a public repository (e.g. Docker Hub) and run it on your local machine. Run the container as a non-root user (Hint- Use `usermod ` command to give user permission to docker). Make sure you reboot instance after giving permission to user.
- Inspect the container's running processes and exposed ports using the docker inspect command.
- Use the docker logs command to view the container's log output.
- Use the docker stop and docker start commands to stop and start the container.
- Use the docker rm command to remove the container when you're done.

## How to run Docker commands without sudo?

- Make sure docker is installed and system is updated (This is already been completed as a part of previous tasks):
- sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
- Reboot the machine.

For reference you can watch this [video](https://youtu.be/Tevxhn6Odc8)

## Day 19
# Day 19 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers

**Till now you have learned how to create docker-compose.yml file and pushed it to the Repository. Let's move forward and dig more on other Docker-compose.yml concepts.**
**Aaj thodi padhai krte hai on Docker Volume & Docker Network** 😃

# Docker-Volume

Docker allows you to create something called volumes. Volumes are like separate storage areas that can be accessed by containers. They allow you to store data, like a database, outside the container, so it doesn't get deleted when the container is deleted.
You can also mount from the same volume and create more containers having same data.
[reference](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)

# Docker Network

Docker allows you to create virtual spaces called networks, where you can connect multiple containers (small packages that hold all the necessary files for a specific application to run) together. This way, the containers can communicate with each other and with the host machine (the computer on which the Docker is installed).
When we run a container, it has its own storage space that is only accessible by that specific container. If we want to share that storage space with other containers, we can't do that. [reference](https://docs.docker.com/network/)

## Task-1

- Create a multi-container docker-compose file which will bring _UP_ and bring _DOWN_ containers in a single shot ( Example - Create application and database container )

_hints:_

- Use the `docker-compose up` command with the `-d` flag to start a multi-container application in detached mode.
- Use the `docker-compose scale` command to increase or decrease the number of replicas for a specific service. You can also add [`replicas`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63408708/how-to-scale-from-within-docker-compose-file) in deployment file for _auto-scaling_.
- Use the `docker-compose ps` command to view the status of all containers, and `docker-compose logs` to view the logs of a specific service.
- Use the `docker-compose down` command to stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes associated with the application

## Task-2

- Learn how to use Docker Volumes and Named Volumes to share files and directories between multiple containers.
- Create two or more containers that read and write data to the same volume using the `docker run --mount` command.
- Verify that the data is the same in all containers by using the docker exec command to run commands inside each container.
- Use the docker volume ls command to list all volumes and docker volume rm command to remove the volume when you're done.

## You can use this task as _Project_ to add in your resume.

## Day 22
# Day-22 : Getting Started with Jenkins 😃

**Linux, Git, Git-Hub, Docker finish ho chuka hai to chaliye seekhte hai inko deploy krne ke lye CI-CD tool:**

## What is Jenkins?

- Jenkins is an open source continuous integration-continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool written in the Java programming language. It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.

- Jenkins is a tool that is used for automation, and it is an open-source server that allows all the developers to build, test and deploy software. It works or runs on java as it is written in java. By using Jenkins we can make a continuous integration of projects(jobs) or end-to-endpoint automation.

- Jenkins achieves Continuous Integration with the help of plugins. Plugins allow the integration of Various DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you need to install the plugins for that tool. For example Git, Maven 2 project, Amazon EC2, HTML publisher etc.

**Let us do discuss the necessity of this tool before going ahead to the procedural part for installation:**

- Nowadays, humans are becoming lazy😴 day by day so even having digital screens and just one click button in front of us then also need some automation.

- Here, I’m referring to that part of automation where we need not have to look upon a process(here called a job) for completion and after it doing another job. For that, we have Jenkins with us.

Note: By now Jenkins should be installed on your machine(as it was a part of previous tasks, if not follow [Installation Guide](https://youtu.be/OkVtBKqMt7I))

## Tasks:

**1. What you understood in Jenkin, write a small article in your own words (Don't copy from Internet Directly)**

**2.Create a freestyle pipeline to print "Hello World!!**
Hint: Use link for [Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-jenkins)

Don't forget to post your progress on Linkedin. Till then Happy learning :)

## Day 23
# Day 23 Task: Jenkins Freestyle Project for DevOps Engineers.

The Community is absolutely crushing it in the #90daysofdevops journey. Today's challenge is particularly exciting as it entails creating a Jenkins Freestyle Project, an opportunity for DevOps engineers to showcase their skills and push their limits. Who's ready to dive in and make it happen? 😍

## What is CI/CD?

- CI or Continuous Integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple developers into a single codebase. It is a software development practice where the developers commit their work frequently into the central code repository (Github or Stash). Then there are automated tools that build the newly committed code and do a code review, etc as required upon integration.
  The key goals of Continuous Integration are to find and address bugs quicker, make the process of integrating code across a team of developers easier, improve software quality and reduce the time it takes to release new feature updates.

- CD or Continuous Delivery is carried out after Continuous Integration to make sure that we can release new changes to our customers quickly in an error-free way. This includes running integration and regression tests in the staging area (similar to the production environment) so that the final release is not broken in production. It ensures to automate the release process so that we have a release-ready product at all times and we can deploy our application at any point in time.

## What Is a Build Job?

A Jenkins build job contains the configuration for automating a specific task or step in the application building process. These tasks include gathering dependencies, compiling, archiving, or transforming code, and testing and deploying code in different environments.

Jenkins supports several types of build jobs, such as freestyle projects, pipelines, multi-configuration projects, folders, multibranch pipelines, and organization folders.

## What is Freestyle Projects ?? 🤔

A freestyle project in Jenkins is a type of project that allows you to build, test, and deploy software using a variety of different options and configurations. Here are a few tasks that you could complete when working with a freestyle project in Jenkins:

# Task-01

- create a agent for your app. ( which you deployed from docker in earlier task)
- Create a new Jenkins freestyle project for your app.
- In the "Build" section of the project, add a build step to run the "docker build" command to build the image for the container.
- Add a second step to run the "docker run" command to start a container using the image created in step 3.

# Task-02

- Create Jenkins project to run "docker-compose up -d" command to start the multiple containers defined in the compose file (Hint- use day-19 Application & Database docker-compose file)
- Set up a cleanup step in the Jenkins project to run "docker-compose down" command to stop and remove the containers defined in the compose file.

## Day 26
# Day 26 Task: Jenkins Declarative Pipeline

One of the most important parts of your DevOps and CICD journey is a Declarative Pipeline Syntax of Jenkins

## Some terms for your Knowledge

**What is Pipeline -** A pipeline is a collection of steps or jobs interlinked in a sequence.

**Declarative:** Declarative is a more recent and advanced implementation of a pipeline as a code.

**Scripted:** Scripted was the first and most traditional implementation of the pipeline as a code in Jenkins. It was designed as a general-purpose DSL (Domain Specific Language) built with Groovy.

# Why you should have a Pipeline

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a [`Jenkinsfile`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile)) which in turn can be committed to a project’s source control repository.  
This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-code"; treating the CD pipeline as a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like any other code.

**Creating a `Jenkinsfile` and committing it to source control provides a number of immediate benefits:**

- Automatically creates a Pipeline build process for all branches and pull requests.
- Code review/iteration on the Pipeline (along with the remaining source code).

# Pipeline syntax

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Task-01

- Create a New Job, this time select Pipeline instead of Freestyle Project.
- Follow the Official Jenkins [Hello world example](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/)
- Complete the example using the Declarative pipeline
- In case of any issues feel free to post on any Groups, [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q6ntmMtH) or [Telegram](https://t.me/trainwithshubham)

You can post your progress on LinkedIn and let us know what you have learned from this task by #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge.

## Day 27
# Day 27 Task: Jenkins Declarative Pipeline with Docker

Day 26 was all about a Declarative pipeline, now its time to level up things, let's integrate Docker and your Jenkins declarative pipeline

## Use your Docker Build and Run Knowledge

**docker build -** you can use `sh 'docker build . -t <tag>' ` in your pipeline stage block to run the docker build command. (Make sure you have docker installed with correct permissions.

**docker run:** you can use `sh 'docker run -d  <image>'` in your pipeline stage block to build the container.

**How will the stages look**

```groovy
stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t trainwithshubham/django-app:latest'
            }
        }
    }
```

# Task-01

- Create a docker-integrated Jenkins declarative pipeline
- Use the above-given syntax using `sh` inside the stage block
- You will face errors in case of running a job twice, as the docker container will be already created, so for that do task 2

# Task-02

- Create a docker-integrated Jenkins declarative pipeline using the `docker` groovy syntax inside the stage block.
- You won't face errors, you can Follow [this documentation](https://tempora-mutantur.github.io/jenkins.io/github_pages_test/doc/book/pipeline/docker/)

- Complete your previous projects using this Declarative pipeline approach

- In case of any issues feel free to post on any Groups, [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q6ntmMtH) or [Telegram](https://t.me/trainwithshubham)

## Day 28
# Day 28 Task: Jenkins Agents

# Jenkins Master (Server)

Jenkins’s server or master node holds all key configurations. Jenkins master server is like a control server that orchestrates all the workflow defined in the pipelines. For example, scheduling a job, monitoring the jobs, etc.

# Jenkins Agent

An agent is typically a machine or container that connects to a Jenkins master and this agent that actually execute all the steps mentioned in a Job. When you create a Jenkins job, you have to assign an agent to it. Every agent has a label as a unique identifier.

When you trigger a Jenkins job from the master, the actual execution happens on the agent node that is configured in the job.

A single, monolithic Jenkins installation can work great for a small team with a relatively small number of projects. As your needs grow, however, it often becomes necessary to scale up. Jenkins provides a way to do this called “master to agent connection.” Instead of serving the Jenkins UI and running build jobs all on a single system, you can provide Jenkins with agents to handle the execution of jobs while the master serves the Jenkins UI and acts as a control node.

 <p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115981550/215276859-fa140ab7-e905-41c9-8ae2-1eef577c5e72.png" /></p>

## Pre-requisites

Let’s say we’re starting with a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 Linux installation. To get an agent working make sure you install Java ( same version as jenkins master server ) and Docker on it.

`Note:-
While creating an agent, be sure to separate rights, permissions, and ownership for jenkins users. `

# Task-01

- Create an agent by setting up a node on Jenkins

- Create a new AWS EC2 Instance and connect it to master(Where Jenkins is installed)

- The connection of master and agent requires SSH and the public-private key pair exchange.
- Verify its status under "Nodes" section.

- You can follow [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chetanrakhra_devops-project-share-activity-7017885886461698048-os5f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android) for the same

# Task-02

- Run your previous Jobs (which you built on Day 26, and Day 27) on the new agent

- Use labels for the agent, your master server should trigger builds for the agent server.

- In case of any issues feel free to post on any Groups, [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q6ntmMtH) or [Telegram](https://t.me/trainwithshubham)

## Day 30
## Day 30 Task: Kubernetes Architecture

<p  align="center"><img  align="center"  src="https://kubernetes.io/images/kubernetes-horizontal-color.png"  /></p>

## Kubernetes Overview

With the widespread adoption of [containers](https://cloud.google.com/containers) among organizations, Kubernetes, the container-centric management software, has become a standard to deploy and operate containerized applications and is one of the most important parts of DevOps.

Originally developed at Google and released as open-source in 2014. Kubernetes builds on 15 years of running Google's containerized workloads and the valuable contributions from the open-source community. Inspired by Google’s internal cluster management system, [Borg](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html),

## Tasks

1. What is Kubernetes? Write in your own words and why do we call it k8s?

2. What are the benefits of using k8s?

3. Explain the architecture of Kubernetes, refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/FqfoDUhzyDo)

4. What is Control Plane?

5. Write the difference between kubectl and kubelets.

6. Explain the role of the API server.

Kubernetes architecture is important, so make sure you spend a day understanding it. [This video](https://youtu.be/FqfoDUhzyDo) will surely help you.

## Day 31
## Day 31 Task: Launching your First Kubernetes Cluster with Nginx running

### Awesome! You learned the architecture of one of the top most important tool "Kubernetes" in your previous task.

## What about doing some hands-on now?

Let's read about minikube and implement _k8s_ in our local machine

1. **What is minikube?**

_Ans_:- Minikube is a tool which quickly sets up a local Kubernetes cluster on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It can deploy as a VM, a container, or on bare-metal.

Minikube is a pared-down version of Kubernetes that gives you all the benefits of Kubernetes with a lot less effort.

This makes it an interesting option for users who are new to containers, and also for projects in the world of edge computing and the Internet of Things.

2. **Features of minikube**

_Ans_ :-

(a) Supports the latest Kubernetes release (+6 previous minor versions)

(b) Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)

(c) Deploy as a VM, a container, or on bare-metal

(d) Multiple container runtimes (CRI-O, containerd, docker)

(e) Direct API endpoint for blazing fast image load and build

(f) Advanced features such as LoadBalancer, filesystem mounts, FeatureGates, and network policy

(g) Addons for easily installed Kubernetes applications

(h) Supports common CI environments

## Task-01:

## Install minikube on your local

For installation, you can Visit [this page](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

If you want to try an alternative way, you can check [this](https://k8s-docs.netlify.app/en/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

## Let's understand the concept **pod**

_Ans:-_

Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific "logical host": it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled.

You can read more about pod from [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) .

## Task-02:

## Create your first pod on Kubernetes through minikube.

We are suggesting you make an nginx pod, but you can always show your creativity and do it on your own.

**Having an issue? Don't worry, adding a sample yaml file for pod creation, you can always refer that.**

_Happy Learning :)_

## Day 32
## Day 32 Task: Launching your Kubernetes Cluster with Deployment

### Congratulation ! on your learning on K8s on Day-31

## What is Deployment in k8s

A Deployment provides a configuration for updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new replicas for scaling, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

## Today's task let's keep it very simple.

## Task-1:

**Create one Deployment file to deploy a sample todo-app on K8s using "Auto-healing" and "Auto-Scaling" feature**

- add a deployment.yml file (sample is kept in the folder for your reference)
- apply the deployment to your k8s (minikube) cluster by command
  `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`

Let's make your resume shine with one more project ;)

**Having an issue? Don't worry, adding a sample deployment file , you can always refer that or wathch [this video](https://youtu.be/ONrbWFJXLLk)**

# Day 33 Task: Working with Namespaces and Services in Kubernetes

### Congrats🎊🎉 on updating your Deployment yesterday💥🙌

## What are Namespaces and Services in k8s

In Kubernetes, Namespaces are used to create isolated environments for resources. Each Namespace is like a separate cluster within the same physical cluster. Services are used to expose your Pods and Deployments to the network. Read more about Namespace [Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/)

# Today's task:

## Task 1:

- Create a Namespace for your Deployment

- Use the command `kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>` to create a Namespace

- Update the deployment.yml file to include the Namespace

- Apply the updated deployment using the command:
  `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n <namespace-name>`

- Verify that the Namespace has been created by checking the status of the Namespaces in your cluster.

## Task 2:

- Read about Services, Load Balancing, and Networking in Kubernetes. Refer official documentation of kubernetes [Link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/)

Need help with Namespaces? Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/K3jNo4z5Jx8) for assistance.

Keep growing your Kubernetes knowledge💥🙌

Happy Learning! :)

## Day 34
# Day 34 Task: Working with Services in Kubernetes

### Congratulation🎊 on your learning on Deployments in K8s on Day-33

## What are Services in K8s

In Kubernetes, Services are objects that provide stable network identities to Pods and abstract away the details of Pod IP addresses. Services allow Pods to receive traffic from other Pods, Services, and external clients.

## Task-1:

- Create a Service for your todo-app Deployment from Day-32
- Create a Service definition for your todo-app Deployment in a YAML file.
- Apply the Service definition to your K8s (minikube) cluster using the `kubectl apply -f service.yml -n <namespace-name>` command.
- Verify that the Service is working by accessing the todo-app using the Service's IP and Port in your Namespace.

## Task-2:

- Create a ClusterIP Service for accessing the todo-app from within the cluster
- Create a ClusterIP Service definition for your todo-app Deployment in a YAML file.
- Apply the ClusterIP Service definition to your K8s (minikube) cluster using the `kubectl apply -f cluster-ip-service.yml -n <namespace-name>` command.
- Verify that the ClusterIP Service is working by accessing the todo-app from another Pod in the cluster in your Namespace.

## Task-3:

- Create a LoadBalancer Service for accessing the todo-app from outside the cluster
- Create a LoadBalancer Service definition for your todo-app Deployment in a YAML file.
- Apply the LoadBalancer Service definition to your K8s (minikube) cluster using the `kubectl apply -f load-balancer-service.yml -n <namespace-name>` command.
- Verify that the LoadBalancer Service is working by accessing the todo-app from outside the cluster in your Namespace.

## Day 35
# Day 35: Mastering ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes🔒🔑🛡️

### 👏🎉 Yay! Yesterday we conquered Namespaces and Services 💪💻🔗🚀

## What are ConfigMaps and Secrets in k8s

In Kubernetes, ConfigMaps and Secrets are used to store configuration data and secrets, respectively. ConfigMaps store configuration data as key-value pairs, while Secrets store sensitive data in an encrypted form.

- _Example :- Imagine you're in charge of a big spaceship (Kubernetes cluster) with lots of different parts (containers) that need information to function properly.
  ConfigMaps are like a file cabinet where you store all the information each part needs in simple, labeled folders (key-value pairs).
  Secrets, on the other hand, are like a safe where you keep the important, sensitive information that shouldn't be accessible to just anyone (encrypted data).
  So, using ConfigMaps and Secrets, you can ensure each part of your spaceship (Kubernetes cluster) has the information it needs to work properly and keep sensitive information secure! 🚀_
- Read more about [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) & [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

## Today's task:

## Task 1:

- Create a ConfigMap for your Deployment
- Create a ConfigMap for your Deployment using a file or the command line
- Update the deployment.yml file to include the ConfigMap
- Apply the updated deployment using the command: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n <namespace-name>`
- Verify that the ConfigMap has been created by checking the status of the ConfigMaps in your Namespace.

## Task 2:

- Create a Secret for your Deployment
- Create a Secret for your Deployment using a file or the command line
- Update the deployment.yml file to include the Secret
- Apply the updated deployment using the command: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n <namespace-name>`
- Verify that the Secret has been created by checking the status of the Secrets in your Namespace.

## Day 36
# Day 36 Task: Managing Persistent Volumes in Your Deployment 💥

🙌 Kudos to you for conquering ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes yesterday.

🔥 You're on fire! 🔥

## What are Persistent Volumes in k8s

In Kubernetes, a Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. The PVC references the PV, and the PV is bound to a specific node. Read official documentation of [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).

⏰ Wait, wait, wait! 📣 Attention all #90daysofDevOps Challengers. 💪

Read from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/)

## User Data in AWS:

- When you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you have the option of passing user data to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. You can pass two types of user data to Amazon EC2: shell scripts and cloud-init directives.
- You can also pass this data into the launch instance wizard as plain text, as a file (this is useful for launching instances using the command line tools), or as base64-encoded text (for API calls).
- This will save time and manual effort everytime you launch an instance and want to install any application on it like apache, docker, Jenkins etc

## Day 40
# Day 40 AWS EC2 Automation ☁

![AWS](https://www.eginnovations.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-AWS-Cloud-Topimage-1.jpg)

I hope your journey with AWS cloud and automation is going well [](https://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%98%8D/)

### 😍

## Automation in EC2:

Amazon EC2 or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud can give you secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective computing infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.

Also, if you know a few things, you can automate many things.

Read from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

## Launch template in AWS EC2:

- You can make a launch template with the configuration information you need to start an instance. You can save launch parameters in launch templates so you don't have to type them in every time you start a new instance.
- For example, a launch template can have the AMI ID, instance type, and network settings that you usually use to launch instances.
- You can tell the Amazon EC2 console to use a certain launch template when you start an instance.

Read more from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html)

## Instance Types:

Amazon EC2 has a large number of instance types that are optimised for different uses. The different combinations of CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity in instance types give you the freedom to choose the right mix of resources for your apps. Each instance type comes with one or more instance sizes, so you can adjust your resources to meet the needs of the workload you want to run.

Read from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/?trk=32f4fbd0-ffda-4695-a60c-8857fab7d0dd&sc_channel=ps&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!536392685920!e!!g!!ec2%20instance%20types&ef_id=CjwKCAiA0JKfBhBIEiwAPhZXD_O1-3qZkRa-KScynbwjvHd3l4UHSTfKuigd5ZPukXoDXu-v3MtC7hoCafEQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!536392685920!e!!g!!ec2%20instance%20types)

## AMI:

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an image that AWS supports and keeps up to date. It contains the information needed to start an instance. When you launch an instance, you must choose an AMI. When you need multiple instances with the same configuration, you can launch them from a single AMI.

### Task1:

- Create a launch template with Amazon Linux 2 AMI and t2.micro instance type with Jenkins and Docker setup (You can use the Day 39 User data script for installing the required tools.

- Create 3 Instances using Launch Template, there must be an option that shows number of instances to be launched ,can you find it? :)

- You can go one step ahead and create an auto-scaling group, sounds tough?

Check [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html#create-launch-template-for-auto-scaling) out

### Hi, I hope you had a great day yesterday learning about the launch template and instances in EC2. Today, we are going to dive into one of the most important concepts in EC2: Load Balancing.

## What is Load Balancing?

Load balancing is the distribution of workloads across multiple servers to ensure consistent and optimal resource utilization. It is an essential aspect of any large-scale and scalable computing system, as it helps you to improve the reliability and performance of your applications.

## Elastic Load Balancing:

**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. ELB provides three types of load balancers:

Read more from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/what-is-load-balancing.html)

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - _operates at layer 7 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require advanced routing and microservices._

- Read more from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** - _operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require high throughput and low latency._

- Read more from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html)

3. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** - _operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require basic load balancing features._

- Read more [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html)

## 🎯 Today's Tasks:

### Task 1:

- launch 2 EC2 instances with an Ubuntu AMI and use User Data to install the Apache Web Server.
- Modify the index.html file to include your name so that when your Apache server is hosted, it will display your name also do it for 2nd instance which include " TrainWithShubham Community is Super Aweasome :) ".
- Copy the public IP address of your EC2 instances.
- Open a web browser and paste the public IP address into the address bar.
- You should see a webpage displaying information about your PHP installation.

### Task 2:

- Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in EC2 using the AWS Management Console.
- Add EC2 instances which you launch in task-1 to the ALB as target groups.
- Verify that the ALB is working properly by checking the health status of the target instances and testing the load balancing capabilities.

Today will be a great learning for sure. I know many of you may not know about the term "ECS". As you know, 90 Days Of DevOps Challenge is mostly about 'learning new' , let's learn then ;)

## What is ECS ?

- ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a fully-managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run and manage Docker containers on a cluster of virtual machines (EC2 instances) without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

With ECS, you can easily deploy, manage, and scale your containerized applications using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the API. ECS supports both "Fargate" and "EC2 launch types", which means you can run your containers on AWS-managed infrastructure or your own EC2 instances.

ECS also integrates with other AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, and Amazon VPC, allowing you to build scalable and highly available applications. Additionally, ECS has support for Docker Compose and Kubernetes, making it easy to adopt existing container workflows.

Overall, ECS is a powerful and flexible container orchestration service that can help simplify the deployment and management of containerized applications in AWS.

## Difference between EKS and ECS ?

- EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) and ECS (Elastic Container Service) are both container orchestration platforms provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). While both platforms allow you to run containerized applications in the AWS cloud, there are some differences between the two.

**Architecture**:
ECS is based on a centralized architecture, where there is a control plane that manages the scheduling of containers on EC2 instances. On the other hand, EKS is based on a distributed architecture, where the Kubernetes control plane is distributed across multiple EC2 instances.

**Kubernetes Support**:
EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service, meaning that it supports Kubernetes natively and allows you to run your Kubernetes workloads on AWS without having to manage the Kubernetes control plane. ECS, on the other hand, has its own orchestration engine and does not support Kubernetes natively.

**Scaling**:
EKS is designed to automatically scale your Kubernetes cluster based on demand, whereas ECS requires you to configure scaling policies for your tasks and services.

**Flexibility**:
EKS provides more flexibility than ECS in terms of container orchestration, as it allows you to customize and configure Kubernetes to meet your specific requirements. ECS is more restrictive in terms of the options available for container orchestration.

**Community**:
Kubernetes has a large and active open-source community, which means that EKS benefits from a wide range of community-driven development and support. ECS, on the other hand, has a smaller community and is largely driven by AWS itself.

In summary, EKS is a good choice if you want to use Kubernetes to manage your containerized workloads on AWS, while ECS is a good choice if you want a simpler, more managed platform for running your containerized applications.

# Task :

Set up ECS (Elastic Container Service) by setting up Nginx on ECS.

## Day 54
# Day 54: Understanding Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management

## What's the difference bhaiyya?

When it comes to the cloud, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration Management (CM) are inseparable. With IaC, a descriptive model is used for infrastructure management. To name a few examples of infrastructure: networks, virtual computers, and load balancers. Using an IaC model always results in the same setting.

Throughout the lifecycle of a product, Configuration Management (CM) ensures that the performance, functional and physical inputs, requirements, design, and operations of that product remain consistent.

# Task-01

- Read more about IaC and Config. Management Tools
- Give differences on both with suitable examples
- What are most commont IaC and Config management Tools?

## Day 62
# Day 62 - Terraform and Docker 🔥

Terraform needs to be told which provider to be used in the automation, hence we need to give the provider name with source and version.
For Docker, we can use this block of code in your main.tf

## Blocks and Resources in Terraform

## Terraform block

## Task-01

- Create a Terraform script with Blocks and Resources

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.21.0"
}
}
}
```

### Note: kreuzwerker/docker, is shorthand for registry.terraform.io/kreuzwerker/docker.

## Provider Block

The provider block configures the specified provider, in this case, docker. A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to create and manage your resources.

```
provider "docker" {}
```

## Resource

Use resource blocks to define components of your infrastructure. A resource might be a physical or virtual component such as a Docker container, or it can be a logical resource such as a Heroku application.

Resource blocks have two strings before the block: the resource type and the resource name. In this example, the first resource type is docker_image and the name is Nginx.

## Task-02

- Create a resource Block for an nginx docker image

Hint:

```
resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
 name         = "nginx:latest"
 keep_locally = false
}
```

- Create a resource Block for running a docker container for nginx

```
resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
 image = docker_image.nginx.latest
 name  = "tutorial"
 ports {
   internal = 80
   external = 80
 }
}
```

Note: In case Docker is not installed

`sudo apt-get install docker.io`
`sudo docker ps`
`sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock`

## Day 63
# Day 63 - Terraform Variables

variables in Terraform are quite important, as you need to hold values of names of instance, configs , etc.

We can create a variables.tf file which will hold all the variables.

```
variable "filename" {
default = "/home/ubuntu/terrform-tutorials/terraform-variables/demo-var.txt"
}
```

```
variable "content" {
default = "This is coming from a variable which was updated"
}
```

These variables can be accessed by var object in main.tf

## Task-01

- Create a local file using Terraform
  Hint:

```
resource "local_file" "devops" {
filename = var.filename
content = var.content
}
```

## Data Types in Terraform

## Map

```
variable "file_contents" {
type = map
default = {
"statement1" = "this is cool"
"statement2" = "this is cooler"
}
}
```

## Task-02

- Use terraform to demonstrate usage of List, Set and Object datatypes
- Put proper screenshots of the outputs

Use `terraform refresh`

To refresh the state by your configuration file, reloads the variables

## Day 64
# Day 64 - Terraform with AWS

Provisioning on AWS is quite easy and straightforward with Terraform.

## Prerequisites

### AWS CLI installed

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

### AWS IAM user

IAM (Identity Access Management) AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

_In order to connect your AWS account and Terraform, you need the access keys and secret access keys exported to your machine._

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret access key>
```

### Install required providers

```
terraform {
 required_providers {
        aws = {
        source  = "hashicorp/aws"
        version = "~> 4.16"
}
}
        required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}
```

Add the region where you want your instances to be

```
provider "aws" {
region = "us-east-1"
}
```

## Task-01

- Provision an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform

Hint:

```
resource "aws_instance" "aws_ec2_test" {
        count = 4
        ami = "ami-08c40ec9ead489470"
        instance_type = "t2.micro"
        tags = {
     Name = "TerraformTestServerInstance"
  }
}
```

# Video Course

## Day 65
# Day 65 - Working with Terraform Resources 🚀

Yesterday, we saw how to create a Terraform script with Blocks and Resources. Today, we will dive deeper into Terraform resources.

## Understanding Terraform Resources

A resource in Terraform represents a component of your infrastructure, such as a physical server, a virtual machine, a DNS record, or an S3 bucket. Resources have attributes that define their properties and behaviors, such as the size and location of a virtual machine or the domain name of a DNS record.

When you define a resource in Terraform, you specify the type of resource, a unique name for the resource, and the attributes that define the resource. Terraform uses the resource block to define resources in your Terraform configuration.

## Task 1: Create a security group

To allow traffic to the EC2 instance, you need to create a security group. Follow these steps:

In your main.tf file, add the following code to create a security group:

```
resource "aws_security_group" "web_server" {
  name_prefix = "web-server-sg"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

- Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform project.

- Run terraform apply to create the security group.

## Task 2: Create an EC2 instance

- Now you can create an EC2 instance with Terraform. Follow these steps:

- In your main.tf file, add the following code to create an EC2 instance:

```
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0557a15b87f6559cf"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key-pair"
  security_groups = [
    aws_security_group.web_server.name
  ]

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "<html><body><h1>Welcome to my website!</h1></body></html>" > index.html
              nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &
              EOF
}
```

Note: Replace the ami and key_name values with your own. You can find a list of available AMIs in the AWS documentation.

Run terraform apply to create the EC2 instance.

## Task 3: Access your website

- Now that your EC2 instance is up and running, you can access the website you just hosted on it. Follow these steps:

Happy Terraforming!

## Day 68
# Day 68 - Scaling with Terraform 🚀

Yesterday, we learned how to AWS S3 Bucket with Terraform. Today, we will see how to scale our infrastructure with Terraform.

## Understanding Scaling

Scaling is the process of adding or removing resources to match the changing demands of your application. As your application grows, you will need to add more resources to handle the increased load. And as the load decreases, you can remove the extra resources to save costs.

Terraform makes it easy to scale your infrastructure by providing a declarative way to define your resources. You can define the number of resources you need and Terraform will automatically create or destroy the resources as needed.

## Task 1: Create an Auto Scaling Group

Auto Scaling Groups are used to automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on the current demand. Follow these steps to create an Auto Scaling Group:

- In your main.tf file, add the following code to create an Auto Scaling Group:

```
resource "aws_launch_configuration" "web_server_as" {
  image_id        = "ami-005f9685cb30f234b"
  instance_type  = "t2.micro"
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.web_server.name]

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "<html><body><h1>You're doing really Great</h1></body></html>" > index.html
              nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &
              EOF
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "web_server_asg" {
  name                 = "web-server-asg"
  launch_configuration = aws_launch_configuration.web_server_lc.name
  min_size             = 1
  max_size             = 3
  desired_capacity     = 2
  health_check_type    = "EC2"
  load_balancers       = [aws_elb.web_server_lb.name]
  vpc_zone_identifier  = [aws_subnet.public_subnet_1a.id, aws_subnet.public_subnet_1b.id]
}


```

- Run terraform apply to create the Auto Scaling Group.

## Task 2: Test Scaling

- Go to the AWS Management Console and select the Auto Scaling Groups service.

- Select the Auto Scaling Group you just created and click on the "Edit" button.

- Increase the "Desired Capacity" to 3 and click on the "Save" button.

- Wait a few minutes for the new instances to be launched.

- Go to the EC2 Instances service and verify that the new instances have been launched.

- Decrease the "Desired Capacity" to 1 and wait a few minutes for the extra instances to be terminated.

- Go to the EC2 Instances service and verify that the extra instances have been terminated.

Congratulations🎊🎉 You have successfully scaled your infrastructure with Terraform.

## Day 69
# Day 69 - Meta-Arguments in Terraform

When you define a resource block in Terraform, by default, this specifies one resource that will be created. To manage several of the same resources, you can use either count or for_each, which removes the need to write a separate block of code for each one. Using these options reduces overhead and makes your code neater.

count is what is known as a ‘meta-argument’ defined by the Terraform language. Meta-arguments help achieve certain requirements within the resource block.

## Count

The count meta-argument accepts a whole number and creates the number of instances of the resource specified.

When each instance is created, it has its own distinct infrastructure object associated with it, so each can be managed separately. When the configuration is applied, each object can be created, destroyed, or updated as appropriate.

eg.

```

terraform {

required_providers {

aws = {

source = "hashicorp/aws"

version = "~> 4.16"

}

}

required_version = ">= 1.2.0"

}



provider "aws" {

region = "us-east-1"

}



resource "aws_instance" "server" {

count = 4



ami = "ami-08c40ec9ead489470"

instance_type = "t2.micro"



tags = {

Name = "Server ${count.index}"

}

}



```

## for_each

Like the count argument, the for_each meta-argument creates multiple instances of a module or resource block. However, instead of specifying the number of resources, the for_each meta-argument accepts a map or a set of strings. This is useful when multiple resources are required that have different values. Consider our Active directory groups example, with each group requiring a different owner.

```

terraform {

required_providers {

aws = {

source = "hashicorp/aws"

version = "~> 4.16"

}

}

required_version = ">= 1.2.0"

}



provider "aws" {

region = "us-east-1"

}



locals {

ami_ids = toset([

"ami-0b0dcb5067f052a63",

"ami-08c40ec9ead489470",

])

}



resource "aws_instance" "server" {

for_each = local.ami_ids



ami = each.key

instance_type = "t2.micro"

tags = {

Name = "Server ${each.key}"

}

}



Multiple key value iteration

locals {

ami_ids = {

"linux" :"ami-0b0dcb5067f052a63",

"ubuntu": "ami-08c40ec9ead489470",

}

}



resource "aws_instance" "server" {

for_each = local.ami_ids



ami = each.value

instance_type = "t2.micro"



tags = {

Name = "Server ${each.key}"

}

}

```

## Task-01

- Create the above Infrastructure as code and demonstrate the use of Count and for_each.
- Write about meta-arguments and its use in Terraform.

Happy learning :)

## Day 70
# Day 70 - Terraform Modules

- Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module consists of a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory
- A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child module's resources into the configuration in a concise way.
- Modules can also be called multiple times, either within the same configuration or in separate configurations, allowing resource configurations to be packaged and re-used.

### Below is the format on how to use modules:

```
# Creating a AWS EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "server-instance" {
  # Define number of instance
  instance_count = var.number_of_instances

  # Instance Configuration
  ami                    = var.ami
  instance_type          = var.instance_type
  subnet_id              = var.subnet_id
  vpc_security_group_ids = var.security_group

  # Instance Tagsid
  tags = {
    Name = "${var.instance_name}"
  }
}
```

```
# Server Module Variables
variable "number_of_instances" {
  description = "Number of Instances to Create"
  type        = number
  default     = 1
}

variable "instance_name" {
  description = "Instance Name"
}

variable "ami" {
  description = "AMI ID"
  default     = "ami-xxxx"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Instance Type"
}

variable "subnet_id" {
  description = "Subnet ID"
}

variable "security_group" {
  description = "Security Group"
  type        = list(any)
}
```

```
# Server Module Output
output "server_id" {
  description = "Server ID"
  value       = aws_instance.server-instance.id
}

```

## Task-01

Explain the below in your own words and it shouldnt be copied from Internet 😉

- Write about different modules Terraform.
- Difference between Root Module and Child Module.
- Is modules and Namespaces are same? Justify your answer for both Yes/No

You all are doing great, and you have come so far. Well Done Everyone🎉

### 5. You want to know from which paths Terraform is loading providers referenced in your Terraform configuration (\*.tf files). You need to enable debug messages to find this out. Which of the following would achieve this?

A. Set the environment variable TF_LOG=TRACE

B. Set verbose logging for each provider in your Terraform configuration

C. Set the environment variable TF_VAR_log=TRACE

D. Set the environment variable TF_LOG_PATH

### 6. Below command will destroy everything that is being created in the infrastructure. Tell us how would you save any particular resource while destroying the complete infrastructure.

```
terraform destroy
```

### 7. Which module is used to store .tfstate file in S3?

### 8. How do you manage sensitive data in Terraform, such as API keys or passwords?

### 9. You are working on a Terraform project that needs to provision an S3 bucket, and a user with read and write access to the bucket. What resources would you use to accomplish this, and how would you configure them?

### 10. Who maintains Terraform providers?

### 11. How can we export data from one module to another?
